# PINTOS Project
I've been working on the Pintos Project from September 2020 to December.
The purpose of this project is to get a better understanding of computer operating system and experience the implementation of it.
The project is divided into 4 parts which are data structure, user program, file system call, and threads.
C language is used in this project and I have referenced the Pintos Manual book from Stanford Univ.
Each project has a document file that shows what I have done in each project(written in Korean).

  ## Project0
  The aim of this project is to practice and understand the data sturctures of PintOS. This project covers the use of list, hash table, and bitmap.
  
  1. List


  List in PintOS is a doubly linked list. 
  ```c
  struct list_elem
  {
    struct list_elem *prev;
    struct list_elem *next;
  }
  
  struct list_item
  {
    struct list_elem elem;
    int data;
  }
  ```
