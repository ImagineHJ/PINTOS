# PINTOS Project
I've been working on the Pintos Project from September 2020 to December.
The purpose of this project is to get a better understanding of computer operating system and experience the implementation of it.
The project is divided into 4 parts which are data structure, user program, file system call, and threads.
C language is used in this project and I have referenced the Pintos Manual book from Stanford Univ.
Each project has a document file that shows what I have done in each project(written in Korean).
